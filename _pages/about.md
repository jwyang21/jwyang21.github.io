I am a Ph.D. student in [KAIST AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr), advised by [Prof. Edward Choi](https://mp2893.com). My research interest lies at Agentic AI, Large Language Models, and AI for Healthcare. I am currently leading a project to develop a conversational agent that answers human questions accurately in real time, requiring efficient long-term memory and rapid information retrieval. I have also led a project predicting cancer patients' survival using 3D genomic information extracted from DNA methylation data.  
My ultimate goal is to develop AI agents that can converse in a truly human-like manner. I hope my work contributes to building a scientific foundation for human-like agents and translating it into real-world impact.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
