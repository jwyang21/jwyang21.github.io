I am a Ph.D. student in AI at KAIST. My research interests lie in Agentic AI, Large Language Models, and AI for Healthcare. I am currently leading a project to develop a conversational agent capable of answering human questions accurately in real time. To achieve this, the agent must handle long-term memory efficiently and retrieve necessary information rapidly. I have also led a project on predicting cancer patients' survival using three-dimensional (3D) genomic information extracted from DNA methylation data.         
My ultimate goal is to develop AI agents that can converse with people in a truly human-like manner. To accomplish this, many fundamental questions remain open: What does it mean to communicate like a human? What cognitive processes underlie human conversation? Where is the threshold that distinguishes a human-like agent from one that is not? And perhaps most importantly, how can such agents be meaningfully integrated into healthcare to benefit patients and practitioners alike?      
I hope that my work can contribute to building a clearer scientific foundation for human-like AI, and to translating that foundation into real-world impact in healthcare and beyond.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
